# **App Name**: PwD Web3 Nexus

## Core Features:

- Personalized Dashboard: User-friendly dashboard displaying profile verification status, wallet balance, and community highlights.
- Secure Registration: Secure registration process leveraging MetaMask wallet, prompting new users to connect their wallet to the platform upon arrival. Documents uploaded for PwD verification are encrypted locally before IPFS storage.
- Identity Verification: Peer-review DAO via community members rewarding reviewers with PWDToken. Manual verification via NGO/Gov/Partners who decrypt & review submitted documents.
- SBT Minting: Minting of non-transferable Soulbound Token upon succesful PwD verification, associating account verification directly with the user's wallet, rather than third party PII stores.
- Reward Distribution: Earn engagement rewards (PWDToken) for contributing content, moderating groups, participating in governance, and/or referrals of new verified users.
- Community Platform: Create secure, end-to-end encrypted chats & community groups, filterable by interests, location and PwD category. Post/image/video uploads use decentralized IPFS storage.
- ZK Dating: Optional: ZKP 'dating style' tool leverages community reputation 'trust score', filtering and proving criteria without revealing underlying sensitive data
